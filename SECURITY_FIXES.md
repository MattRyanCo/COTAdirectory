# Security and Bug Fixes Report

This document outlines the critical bugs found and fixed in the Family Directory Management application.

## Bug #1: SQL Injection Vulnerability (Critical Security Issue)

**Location**: `app-includes/database-functions.php` lines 56 and 67
**Severity**: Critical
**Type**: Security Vulnerability

### Description
The `read_a_family()` and `read_members_of_family()` functions were vulnerable to SQL injection attacks because they directly concatenated user input into SQL queries without using prepared statements.

### Risk
An attacker could manipulate the `$family_id` parameter to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting database contents.

### Fix Applied
- Updated both functions to use prepared statements with parameter binding
- Added proper error handling and statement cleanup
- Fixed missing function parameter in `read_a_family()`

### Code Changes
```php
// Before (vulnerable):
$families = $this->conn->query("SELECT * FROM families WHERE family_id = " . $family_id);

// After (secure):
$statement = $this->conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM families WHERE family_id = ?");
$statement->bind_param("i", $family_id);
$statement->execute();
$families = $statement->get_result();
```

## Bug #2: Logic Error with Undefined Variables (Runtime Error)

**Location**: `app-includes/add-family.php` lines 32-37
**Severity**: High
**Type**: Logic Error

### Description
The code was using undefined variables `$firstname` and `$lastname` instead of the correctly defined `$first_name` and `$last_name` variables.

### Risk
This would cause PHP errors and prevent the first two family member names from being stored properly in the database, leading to data inconsistency.

### Fix Applied
- Corrected variable names to match the properly defined variables
- Ensured primary family member names are captured correctly

### Code Changes
```php
// Before (broken):
$fname1 = $firstname;
$lname2 = $lastname;

// After (fixed):
$fname1 = $first_name;
$lname2 = $last_name;
```

## Bug #3: Hardcoded Database Credentials (Critical Security Issue)

**Location**: `app-includes/database-functions.php` lines 11-14
**Severity**: Critical
**Type**: Security Vulnerability

### Description
Production database credentials including passwords were hardcoded directly in the source code. This is a severe security vulnerability as anyone with access to the source code can see the database credentials.

### Risk
If the source code is compromised, exposed in version control, or accessible to unauthorized users, the database credentials would be immediately visible, allowing unauthorized database access.

### Fix Applied
- Removed hardcoded production credentials
- Implemented environment variable support for production database configuration
- Created `.env.example` file to document required environment variables
- Updated `.gitignore` to prevent `.env` files from being committed to version control
- Updated database connection logic to use environment variables

### Security Improvements
1. **Environment Variables**: Production credentials now come from environment variables
2. **Documentation**: Created `.env.example` to guide proper configuration
3. **Version Control Protection**: Updated `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files

### Required Environment Variables for Production
```
DB_NAME=cotadirectory
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
DB_HOST=your_db_host
```

## Bug #4: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities (High Security Issue)

**Location**: Multiple files including `add-family.php`, `delete-family.php`, `display-one-family.php`, `edit-family.php`, and `update-family.php`
**Severity**: High
**Type**: Security Vulnerability

### Description
User input from `$_GET['familyname']` was being output directly to HTML without proper sanitization, creating XSS vulnerabilities. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through the familyname parameter.

### Risk
An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers, potentially:
- Stealing session cookies
- Performing actions on behalf of users
- Redirecting users to malicious sites
- Accessing sensitive data

### Fix Applied
1. **Input Sanitization**: Added `cota_sanitize()` calls when reading GET parameters
2. **Output Encoding**: Added `htmlspecialchars()` for HTML contexts
3. **URL Encoding**: Added `urlencode()` for URL contexts
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Fixed all instances across multiple files

### Code Changes Examples
```php
// Before (vulnerable):
$family_name = $_GET["familyname"];
echo "<h2>" . $family_name . " family updated!</h2>";

// After (secure):
$family_name = cota_sanitize($_GET["familyname"]);
echo "<h2>" . htmlspecialchars($family_name) . " family updated!</h2>";
```

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Input Validation**: Continue to validate all user inputs at the application level
2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information
3. **Session Security**: Implement proper session management and CSRF protection
4. **File Upload Security**: If file uploads are implemented, ensure proper validation
5. **Regular Security Audits**: Conduct regular security reviews and penetration testing

## Files Modified

1. `app-includes/database-functions.php` - SQL injection fixes and credential security
2. `app-includes/add-family.php` - Variable name fix and XSS protection
3. `app-includes/delete-family.php` - XSS protection
4. `app-includes/display-one-family.php` - XSS protection
5. `app-includes/edit-family.php` - XSS protection
6. `app-includes/update-family.php` - XSS protection
7. `.env.example` - Environment variable documentation (new file)
8. `.gitignore` - Added environment file exclusions

## Deployment Notes

When deploying to production:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Update `.env` with actual production database credentials
3. Ensure `.env` file permissions are restricted (600)
4. Verify environment variables are properly loaded by the application
5. Test all functionality to ensure fixes don't break existing features
